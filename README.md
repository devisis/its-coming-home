# Its Coming Home

England recently had a brilliant run in the Euros. Runner up, the furthest they've finished in the history of the competition. The goal of Coming Home is to bring to life the essential details of a moment many England fans will hope to cherish for years to come. This will be achieved through the display of fixtures, highlights and stats.

# Testing

## Responsivity 

- I discovered through the use of the developer tools that the site was not optimized for small screen sizes like mobile browsers. The iphone 5 screen size was particularly uncompromising. It seemingly ignored the layout I tried to present. I had to manually add padding to the right side of the screen to center my elements.

- I tested my sites responsivity by changing the screen size via Google Chrome Developer tools and made adjustments to the css where I saw fit.

- I made sure all links in the navbar lead to the right pages. I did this by running through each page clicking on each flag and navigation link.


# Validator Testing

# HTML

- Upon using the w3.org validator I came across a few minor issues. I had to remove my spans which wrapped around each p tag.

- Upon using the validator I came across no issues with the css.
