# Coming Home

England recently had a brilliant run in the Euros. Runner up, the furthest they've finished in the history of the competition.

# Testing

## Responsivity 

I discovered through the use of the developer tools that the site was not optimized for small screen sizes like mobile browsers. The iphone 5 screen size was particularly uncompromising. It seemingly ignored the layout I tried to present. I had to manually add padding to the right side of the screen to center my elements.

I tested my sites responsivity by changing the screen size via Google Chrome Developer tools and made adjustments to the css where I saw fit.

I made sure all links in the navbar lead to the right pages. I did this by running through each page clicking on each flag and navigation link.


# Validator Testing

Upon using the w3.org validator I came across a few minor issues. I had to remove my spans which wrapped around each p tag.
